<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial 
color=#0000ff size=2>In fulfillment of VCDE responsibilities, I was responsible 
for prototyping and proposing&nbsp;a potential process for publishing CTCAE v4 
(and future revisions).&nbsp; I have reached a point where I would like to share 
the preliminary results.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial 
color=#0000ff size=2></FONT></SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial 
color=#0000ff size=2>To develop the process, I focused on creating an updated 
version of the CTCAE quick reference, which is the hardcopy that I 
received.&nbsp; Code was developed in Java to generate&nbsp;documents for 
publication.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial

<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial 
color=#0000ff size=2>I believe the general publication process is in keeping 
with prior discussions, and goes as follows:</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
<UL dir=ltr>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2>Develop CTCAE either in LexWIKI or OWL.&nbsp; It doesn't matter which, 
  as long as the end result can be imported to a LexBIG/EVS repository.&nbsp; 
  There are also certain properties expected by the document generation code 
  (e.g. 'Grade 1', 'Grade 2', 'Short Name').&nbsp; The current names were taken 
  from the LexWIKI-derived source, with the expectation that OWL source would 
  use similar naming conventions.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2>Load CTCAE source to the LexBIG/EVS repository.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2>Run the Java program 
  'org.LexGrid.LexBIG.util.ctcae.QuickRefPublisher'.&nbsp; All source and 
  dependencies&nbsp;for this program are released and available in svn (links 
  provided below).&nbsp; Note that the program currently uses the direct Java 
  API to talk to&nbsp;the LexBIG repository, but could be modified to run 
  against the caGrid API if necessary.&nbsp; We only need query 
  capability.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2>When launched, the program will present a menu of all code systems 
  loaded in the LexBIG/EVS repository.&nbsp; The user needs to select CTCAE from 
  the list.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2>The program generates PDF, HTML, and RTF versions of the 
  document.&nbsp; Each of these has advantages and may be worth considering 
  (more on this below).&nbsp; It takes about 5 seconds to 
  run.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2>To get a feel for what is generated, please see the attached PDF.&nbsp; 
  Note that this is not being submitted for review of the content at this 
  point.&nbsp; It is possible that some of the content that I had is not in 
  final form.&nbsp; The intent is to give you a feel for how the content could 
  be packaged and submitted for review (or everyday use) by end 
  users.</FONT></SPAN></DIV></LI></UL>
<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial 
color=#0000ff size=2>So that's the basics... here are some details 
...</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial 
color=#0000ff size=2></FONT></SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial 
color=#0000ff size=2>The CTCAE&nbsp;quick reference is divided roughly&nbsp;into 
4 sections: front cover, introduction, body (event tables), and back 
cover.&nbsp; The table of contents could be considered a fifth section.&nbsp; 
Here are the approaches taken for each piece of the 
puzzle...</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
<UL dir=ltr>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2><U><STRONG>Front cover</STRONG></U>: The cover is auto-generated by 
  taking some 'stock' wording and inserting the version number of the 
  CTCAE&nbsp;selected by the user.&nbsp; I spent some time futzing to get things 
  to look like the hard copy, perhaps too long, but I&nbsp;felt it was 
  important&nbsp;to ensure that we could deliver something that looked 
  reasonably close to the v3.0 publication.&nbsp; Overall dimensions for the 
  document were also kept as faithful as possible to the original (~5" x 
  7").</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2><STRONG><U>Introduction</U></STRONG>:&nbsp;This is the first&nbsp;page 
  beyond the cover, which&nbsp;provides a narrative overview of the document 
  contents.&nbsp; It is also tricky to automate, since the content is&nbsp;not 
  generated.&nbsp; Instead of generating it on the fly, the program looks 
  for&nbsp;a standard rtf file with this content.&nbsp; This allows the rtf 
  to&nbsp;be edited through a standard word processor such as MS Word, WordPad, 
  or Open Office.&nbsp; I think this makes the most sense, since it will allow 
  the authors to revise the wording using familiar tools without needing to dive 
  into code.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2>Once this intro page is&nbsp;edited, it must be exported to PDF and PNG 
  versions for use by the program.&nbsp; This is a manual 
  step.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2>There are free programs that enable this (e.g. PDF995 can print to PDF, 
  and many programs&nbsp;such as&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;Paint can be used to take a 
  snapshot&nbsp;for export to PNG).&nbsp; The exported size is recommended to be 
  ISO B6 dimensions (~5" x 7", to match the target document).&nbsp; The program 
  takes it from there.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2><STRONG><U>Event Tables</U></STRONG>: These are automatically generated 
  by querying the vocabulary through LexBIG/EVS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the draft 
  does not contain annotations such as 'Remark' or 'Also Consider'.&nbsp; They 
  are not currently&nbsp;in our repository.&nbsp; In the future, the program 
  could by modified to recognize and deal with them.&nbsp; An alternative is to 
  edit the generated RTF afterward to include additional not in the repository 
  itself (see comments on RTF below).</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2><STRONG><U>Back Cover:</U></STRONG> The HHS, NIH, and NCI Logos and 
  document barcode are inserted to this page.&nbsp; Each of these is located in 
  a separate graphic file that is imported and dynamically inserted to the 
  document, so a logo or barcode can change without requiring code 
  change.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2><STRONG><U>Table of Contents</U></STRONG>: Note here...&nbsp; this was 
  previously covered in the Introduction section.&nbsp; It could be added there 
  again via manual edits (as described in the Introduction section above).&nbsp; 
  However,&nbsp;the author&nbsp;would need to see a&nbsp;generated document 
  first to know what page numbers to enter.&nbsp; As an alternative, 'chapter' 
  references are now generated automatically, and can be used in&nbsp;PDF 
  viewers (as PDF Bookmarks) or RTF navigation (e.g. view the 'Document Map' in 
  Word).</FONT></SPAN></DIV></LI></UL>

class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>A few thoughts as 
well&nbsp;on the various formats...</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
<UL dir=ltr>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2><STRONG><U>PDF</U></STRONG>: This is the primary format that I was 
  targeting originally.&nbsp; PDF is nice in terms of being portable across OS 
  platforms, carries a relatively light footprint, and allows the publisher a 
  great deal of control over what the end user can do with it..&nbsp; The 
  thought here is that it may make sense to distribute CTCAE in a downloadable 
  format rather than hardcopy.&nbsp; If so, PDF would be a good choice.&nbsp; It 
  would also be a good choice for making printouts.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2>There is a lot of power here potentially for the future.&nbsp; By 
  default, I generated PDFs with AES 128 bit encryption.&nbsp; Encryption can 
  help prevent unwanted tampering (e.g. someone trying to alter and distribute 
  as if it came from NCI).&nbsp; I also enabled permissions for printing, 
  introducing annotations/comments, screen readers, but no encryption of 
  metadata.&nbsp; You can password-protect to control access to 
  various&nbsp;capabilities by user or owner, etc.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2>There is a method in the publish program where this can all be 
  customized (I take no credit here, it was provided to me by the API that I 
  relied on, named iText).</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2><STRONG><U>HTML</U></STRONG>: In addition to redistribution and print, 
  it seemed likely that NCI might want to serve a standard web page (html) with 
  the CTCAE content.&nbsp; This is also generated by the program.&nbsp; The 
  output is not quite as polished as the PDF, but it is functional and could be 
  prettied up further by those with web-guru-ish 
  capabilities.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2><STRONG><U>RTF</U></STRONG>: This is also generated by the 
  program.&nbsp; While not recommended as a redistribution format or for serving 
  on the web, it does offer the advantage of being editable by standard office 
  tools.&nbsp; So, basically, if the program doesn't generate something quite 
  right it provides an intermediate format that authors can modify without 
  requiring changes to the program itself.&nbsp; While we would like the program 
  to be turn-key and generate everything 100% correct right off the bat, reality 
  doesn't always cooperate.&nbsp; It is nice to have an edit 
  option.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2>The generated RTF, like the HTML, isn't quite as pretty as the 
  PDF.&nbsp; However, I think it is passable as a starting point for applying 
  edit and polish.</FONT></SPAN></DIV></LI></UL>
<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial 
color=#0000ff size=2>One additional note... </FONT></SPAN></DIV>
<UL dir=ltr>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff 
  size=2>You might notice that the 'Introduction' section in the generated RTF 
  (and HTML) is inserted as an image instead of editable text.&nbsp; This may 
  seem confusing, since RTF is intended to be editable, and&nbsp;in my 
  description of the 'Introduction' section above&nbsp;I said we start from RTF 
  source.&nbsp; To make a long story short, it was too messy to try and take the 
  RTF from one source and insert it into another programmatically.&nbsp; Because 
  of formatting mismatches, automated insertion of&nbsp;text from one RTF file 
  to another can start to look like junk rather quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;So by 
  default I inserted the image.&nbsp; However, if an author really wants to edit 
  the intro material in the RTF output, they can manually copy/paste the content 
  from one file to the other and be on their way.</FONT></SPAN></DIV></LI></UL>
<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial

<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=089031117-23022009><FONT face=Arial 
color=#0000ff size=2>So there it is.&nbsp; I propose adhering to the above 
process moving forward with V4 publication, but would be happy to discuss 
further as necessary.&nbsp; I have attached copies of the pdf, html, and rtf 
output (unaltered) for comment.&nbsp; All source files are available in the NCI 
Subversion repository under the "LexEVS" GForge project.&nbsp; The direct URL is
