<h3><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h3>
The LexBIG Data QA System is based around the important notions of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Life Cycle Stages</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Life Cycle Processes</span>.&nbsp; Each
life cycle stage is represented by a particular state of the data in a
particular format (formatted text file, XML file, database tables, API
spec).&nbsp; Each life cycle process represents a transformation of the
data from one state to another.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="details"></a>Details</h3>
Three key topics are covered here:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#count">Counting Life Cycle Data States<br>
    </a></li>
  <li><a href="#comp">Validating Life Cycle Processes - Comparing Data
States<br>
    </a></li>
  <li><a href="#rule">Validating Rules for Data States</a><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="count"></a>Counting Life
Cycle Data States<br>
</span><br>
Each state of the data represents the <a href="dm.html">domain objects</a>
of its life cycle stage in a particular way.&nbsp; Perl or Java tools
are used to generate a series of counts for each domain object
according to a <a href="counts.html">specification</a>.&nbsp; These
sets of counts are recorded in a file system file that has three main
fields:&nbsp; test name, test value, test count.&nbsp; For example,<br>
<pre>nameTally|BROAD,N|1617|</pre>
This entry indicates that the "nameTally" count with the value
"BROAD,N" (which corresponds to a set of fields) has the count
1617.&nbsp; In other words, there are 1617 cases of "name" objects with
that combination of field values.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In some cases, we will know that a count is incorrect for one reason or
another relative to other counts made by the system.&nbsp; For example,
the original file may have duplicates while the loaded database does
not.&nbsp; In the event that something like this happens, an additional
three fields can be added to <span style="font-style: italic;">adjust</span>
the original value.&nbsp; The fields are:&nbsp; adjustment count,
authority, reason.&nbsp; For example, the entry above could be adjusted
as follows:<br>
<pre>nameTally|BROAD,N|1617|3|BAC|3 duplicate cases found in input data|</pre>
Adjustments are made manually by editing the relevant count set file
and adding fields where appropriate.<br>
<br>

 name="comp"></a>Validating Life Cycle Processes - Comparing Data States<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span></span></span></span><br>
Life cycle processes represent transformations of data from one state
to another.&nbsp; Each time a transformation occurs, there is the
potential for data to become corrupted if transformation algorithms are
not correct.&nbsp; By generating counts of conceptual domain objects
for each data state and comparing them across life cycle stages, we can
validate certain aspects of the correctness of the transformation
algorithm.<br>
<br>
Consider the counts file entry shown above. If this same test name (<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">nameTally</span>) and value (<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">BROAD,N</span>) appear across
data states with the
same count, we know that no data of this type has been lost or
gained.&nbsp; We call this
<span style="font-style: italic;">conservation of mass</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This kind of comparison addresses a variety of different potential QA
issues, including:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Transformation algorithm changes field values (inappropriate data
transformation)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Transformation algorithm adds additional values not found in
precursor set (additional data)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Transformation algorithm ignores certain data from precursor set
(lost data)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Transformation algorithm does not view domain objects the same
way in pre/post data states (model mismatch)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
The LexBIG Data QA System has a utility for comparing sets of counts,
including adjustments and preparing a report of the results.&nbsp; It
identifies changes in counts for a particular name/value as well as
name/value pairs that appear in one set of counts that do not appear in
the other set of counts (and vice-versa).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="rule"></a>Validating Rules
for Data States<br>
</span><br>
Generating and comparing counts by domain objects for a particular data
state and across data states is only part of a total QA solution.&nbsp;
While this approach addresses problems with transformation algorithms
relating to the volume of certain kinds of data, it cannot directly
perform semantic validation of individual data states.&nbsp; This is
where rule-based QA comes into focus.<br>
<br>
We have defined a set of semantic QA rules that should apply across all
data states (see <a href="rules.html">Rules Specification</a>).&nbsp;
The tools provided are capable of validating these semantic rules for
the shared data states (like a loaded LexBIG database).&nbsp; However,
native files from terminology providers vary widely in style and
representation.&nbsp; As such, terminology-specific scripts will need
to be developed on a case-by-case basis to validate this same list of
rules.&nbsp; Additionally, individual terminologies may require
additional semantic validation rules that apply only in the case of
that terminology and not in other ones.<br>
<br>
By validating semantic rules for each data state, we add another layer
of guarantee that transformation algorithms are correctly representing
the same data - in the same way - as the original data state.<br>
